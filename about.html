    Hi there,
    my name is Bartosz, and I am learning software engineering and web design. Having spent most of my life working in the hospitality I have decided to do something more interesting while leaving the comfort zone and discovering new topics and learning completely new thigs.
    Last courses I have taken are Web Development on Udemy by Dr Angela Yu and Codespace Bootcamp software engineering indroduction course in Edinburgh College. I am happy to get any feedback.<br />
    <br/>I am enjoy playing my bass guitar and spending my free time playing computer games or learning japanese. My biggest achievement was playing twice for about 80k people with my band. Having fullfilled my childhood dream, my first thought that came to my mind was that, it is actually more stresfull playing for 20 people in the bar than playing big concerts.
